In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utterâ€” they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.
The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Love is a friendship set to music.
A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke.
We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke.
